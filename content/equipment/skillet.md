[10" skillet with detachable handle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BY9VT4F2/ref=nosim?tag=ffwf0f-20)
- 10" at the top should mean 8" at the bottom, which is just the right size for the induction cooktop.
- Reviews say the handle has sharp edges and can hurt to hold, may need to look into a handle cover.
- I personally do not find the handle too sharp, but I can see how some others might.
- The care instructions are pretty much like how you'd treat a cast iron skillet
    - No abrasives
    - No dishwasher
    - Don't soak
    - Clean gently with sponge
    - Dry immediately
