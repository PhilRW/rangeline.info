[PackTowl Luxe]({{<amazon "B07ML47P3B">}})
- Wirecutter's top recommendation.
- Basically a nice microfiber towel with a hanging loop on it so it won't fall off the hooks while we drive down the road.
- They also come with a carrying bag (that also has a hanging loop).
- See a couple of them hanging [here]({{<ref "post/2023-07-09">}})
