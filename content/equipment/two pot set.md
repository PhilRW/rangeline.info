[Two pot set with removable handle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0020TVDDM/ref=nosim?tag=ffwf0f-20) 
- Stainless steel, so it may or may not work with the induction cooktop.
- Some info says it won't work with induction cooktops, but info in reviews of [a different 3-pot set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UABDIC/ref=nosim?tag=ffwf0f-20) says that they do work with induction cooktops.
