[Black flexible curtain track]({{<amazon B09Y1WBVTC>}})
- For mounting curtains on the ceiling between the galley, bathroom, and bed.
- They also make it in white but black will look better in the Rangeline.
- See it installed [here]({{<ref "post/2023-07-09">}})
- I tried installing it with 3M double-sided tape, and it stayed up for a while, but eventually came off. Short of drilling holes in the ceiling, I will look for a tension curtain rod instead.
