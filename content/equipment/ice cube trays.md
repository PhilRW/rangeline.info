- ICEBREAKER POP -- don't know why the product name is shouting, but whatever.
- Two of these will fit in the freezer portion of the fridge, even in their expanded state.
- These are absolutely fantastic for making ice on the go as they do not spill and you can orient them whichever way you want.
- We rotate their position in the freezer so we know which one is the (c)oldest.
	- Doesn't mean it's frozen yet, though.
