[Molle glove pouch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00865O7W8/ref=nosim?tag=ffwf0f-20)
- Looking for a way to store disposable gloves on the Molle panels in the back, so I can grab them when I'm working with the sewer hose.
- Going to try this out and report back on if/how it works.
- Returned it as it is too small to hold many gloves. It's more suitable to wear on a belt or backpack, and the straps aren't spaced properly for the panels on the back doors.
