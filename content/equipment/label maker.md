[Epson LABELWORKS LW-PX800 Industrial Wireless Label Maker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JRJVL6P/ref=nosim?tag=ffwf0f-20)

My research initially led me to Brother label printers, but I thought I'd try the Epson models, for a few reasons:
- They have an amazing warranty.
- They seem to waste less tape.
- They have some good label tape materials available.

I'm a bit disappointed they don't have iron-on or reflective label tape available. Those would be really useful. Ah well, maybe in the future.
