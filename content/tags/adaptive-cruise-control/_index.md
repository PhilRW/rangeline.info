title: "Adaptive Cruise Control"
---
Comes on some chassis and not others. It was first on option on the 2022 chassis; [check the VIN]({{<ref "post/moroney sticker">}}) to be sure.
## Thoughts
- It works okay, but it seems like it doesn't know how heavy the van is. It is slow to accelerate, so by the time it drops out of distance from the vehicle in front of it, it works really hard to accelerate too much and then has to slow down again when it gets back into range. Lots of manual work to set an upper limit that won't cause a surging effect. Not a great implementation. But it's good for some situations, like following traffic at a more or less consistent speed.
- It will slow down all the way to 0 but it will only resume if traffic in front of it gets going within a couple of seconds. Otherwise you have to press the "RES" button or the gas pedal. And it will go quickly, there doesn't seem to be any consideration for accelerating slowly in slow traffic.
- One time in heavy, slow traffic it lost tracking and started to accelerate into the back of the semi trailer in front. So you have to watch the dashboard indicator to see if it is tracking the vehicle in front of you.
- It does not work (or is "limited functionality") in heavy rain, or if the windshield is dirty, or if there's glare.
- It really does help relieve driver fatigue on long stretches of interstate, especially heavy trucking routes.
