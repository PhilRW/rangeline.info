Just returned from a 4,026 mile road trip through 13 states.
- Van performed quite well and averaged 15.6 mpg spending $908.30 on gas.
- Occasionally the ACC would be temporarily disabled, no clue as to why.
- One time in slow traffic the ACC lost track of the car in front of us and started to accelerate into them.
	- This happened one time before on the drive back home from Airstream of Greensboro, also in slow traffic.
- No problems with the van but the inverter/charger was a problem. Other systems worked well.
- The [5 and 3 piece rope basket sets]){{<ref "equipment/rope basket sets">}} fit perfectly in the dinette overhead cabinets and the cabinet over the microwave, respectively.
- After doing an update (update config) from the VegaTouch Mira app, the app now works! Amazing!
