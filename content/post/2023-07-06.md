Until I can work out a vertical tension arm for the [paper towel holder]({{<ref "equipment/paper towel holder">}}), I will be mounting it horizontally. Yes, it will stick out into the key hook hanging area, but hook \#3 still has enough clearance to hang a small [towel]({{<ref "equipment/towels">}}) on it.
- We ordered the 10" x 14" size in the "Aquamarine" and "Vivid Coral" colors.
