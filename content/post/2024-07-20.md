Yesterday the Inverter/Charger stopped working for some reason and I lost all shore power. Powering off everything and restarting the system didn't fix it. 

This morning I *did* fix it by taking apart the SmartPlug power receptacle on the outside and tightening the wire connectors, which were loose! I used a Phillips screwdriver and a 1/8" Allen wrench.

At least it wasn't a software bug this time, but *come on!*
