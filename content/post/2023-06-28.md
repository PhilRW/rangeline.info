- Hello, World!
- I'm always adding to this site. I thought I would share what I have so far.
- There are *two* Facebook groups ðŸ™„
	- [Airstream RANGELINE owners and wannabees group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/809895726815928/) (public group)
	- [Airstream Rangeline Wannabes and Owners](https://www.facebook.com/groups/399267275508711/) (private group)
- Melvin from Firefly says that the fix for the generator randomly shutting off:
	- > We had report of another coach doing the exact same thing as yours, the gen would run for seconds to minutes and then shut down but would run indefinitely when disconnected from the Firefly system. We heard back from the dealership, and they replied:
	  >>Â We replaced the generatorÂ moduleÂ and it fixed the problem.
- Reddit discussion on [Rangeline owner feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/airstream/comments/14kptso/any_rangeline_owner_feedback/)
- [Promaster Forum](https://www.promasterforum.com/) is a good resource for the chassis
