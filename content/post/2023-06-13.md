- Flew to CLT to Uber to GSO to pick up Vandy Patinkin from Airstream of Greensboro
- Ubered to Airstream of Greensboro
	- First Uber ride ever, it was great. Although the vehicle had a bit of an unbalanced-wheel-feel at freeway speeds and I think one of the right turn signal bulbs was burned out.

- The tech at Airstream of Greensboro walked me through the whole coach.
- Running my own [PDI checklist]({{<ref "post/maiden voyage#pdi-checklist">}}), I found that the generator wouldn't stay running.
	- The techs first thought it was the heat on the pavement.
	- Then they thought it was low fuel in the tank.
	- Finally they said the breaker was bad and it would have to be serviced at Cummins.
	- I went on my way without a functional generator.
- Stopped at [Moo & Brew](https://mooandbrew.com/) in Charlotte on the way to Clemson.
	- Good burger. Called "The Farmer's Daughter."
