- Bethany from Airstream sent this guide to check the inverter settings

	- All of my settings look correct but I can't seem to change/save them even if they weren't.
- I should note that I have a great pair of pliers-wrench that are the best I've ever used. They have come in handy working on the van. They're a bit pricey but function much better than other pliers. It's just a clever design.
	- [Knipex 8605180]({{<ref "equipment/pliers wrench">}})
- [Package 1]({{<ref "post/2023-07-06#package-1">}}) was delivered
- Bethany from Airstream says perhaps it's the SeeLevel Soul adapter and/or inverter firmware, dealer would need to fix.
