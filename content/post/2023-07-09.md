- I'm noticing that the inverter shuts off every so often and I can't get it to come back on.
	- Watching [this Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/399267275508711/posts/564077725694331/) to see if replacing the 9-pin Soul SeeLevel module with a 7-pin module will fix it?
- Installed [curtain track]({{<ref "equipment/curtain track">}}) and a [curtain]({{<ref "equipment/curtain">}}).
	- Considering installing the other one somewhere between the galley and the bath for a little changing area, but not sure about where to put the track.
