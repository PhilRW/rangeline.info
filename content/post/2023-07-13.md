	- [Double shower dispenser]({{<ref "equipment/double shower dispenser">}})
		- Perfect spot right below the mirror (make sure the sink has enough clearance). Would have put them higher but my hand needs room to grab the mirror and pull it out. Also leaves room to hang small items from the mirror.
	- [Toothbrush holders]({{<ref "equipment/toothbrush holders">}})
		- Just fits between the sink and the wall. May not fit there in other vans, depending on how it was assembled.
	- [Single soap dispenser]({{<ref "equipment/single soap dispenser">}})
		- Above and to the left of the bath sink; contains liquid hand soap.
- 3D printing some drawer organizers for the drawer just below the galley sink
	- Using Autodesk Fusion 360 for the design.

- The [Aeropress]({{<ref "equipment/aeropress">}}), [Molle glove pouch]({{<ref "equipment/Molle glove pouch">}}), and [USB cable]({{<ref "equipment/usb-c-to-a-cable">}}) all arrived today.
	- I'm going to return the [Molle glove pouch]({{<ref "equipment/Molle glove pouch">}}) as it is too small to hold many gloves. It's more suitable to wear on a belt or backpack, and the straps aren't spaced properly for the panels on the back doors.
