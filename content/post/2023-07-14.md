- So today the van is on shore power and the A/C is running but the house battery is not charging and the microwave is not on. It says the inverter is "off" when it should be "passthru." I tap the inverter button and the inverter turns on and starts drawing power from the battery and the microwave comes on. All while the A/C keeps running.
	- This makes sense since the A/C is controlled by the Firefly but is not powered through the inverter. I imagine the other inverted outlets in addition to the microwave would not be working, but the front ones would still work.
		- [ ] I'll test this with my [outlet tester]({{<ref "equipment/outlet tester">}}) next time.
	- According to the Facebook groups, Airstream still doesn't seem to know what's causing the problem(s) with the inverter.
