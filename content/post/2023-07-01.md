- Found a [front carpet mat]({{<ref "equipment/front carpet mat">}})
- The power center seems to have many open spots for additional 12V circuits, e.g. some [Powerwerx panel-mount](https://powerwerx.com/panel-mounts) stuff.
	- It looks about as simple as putting a fuse in and wiring it up (would need to find a ground point, of course).
	- Will probably put the panel mount in the small cubby.
		- [ ] Determine how to access behind the power center for drilling and running wires.
	- Page 99 "M5-CB3 (RED)" of the owner's [manual]({{<ref "post/owner's manual">}}) is the wire that feeds the 12V panel and it is limited to 30A at M-5.
	- Upstream of M-5 there is a 60A fuse connected to the house main disconnect switch.
