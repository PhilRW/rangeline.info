- The [skillet]({{<ref "equipment/skillet">}}) makes pretty good fried eggs. ðŸ™‚ Or maybe I do and the skillet is a decent tool.
- Here is a helpful video to fix the issue of the house battery not charging when the engine is on:
	- {{<youtube mmpBsELaT60>}}
	- I only have one bit of information to add: make sure there is a tight physical connection between the wires. Electrical tape will not hold over time (even though I also used it as a *temporary* fix). I would personally *not* use the "jumper" method as shown in the video for a permanent solution, only as a hotwired kludge until you can get the appropriate part. If the connection comes loose over time there is a slight possibility of things sparking, melting, or catching fire.
		- Order a factory-specified male connector for the wire and put that in place:
			- Order a [pin]({{<ref "equipment/b pillar parts#pin">}}) for the B-pillar.
				- They will ship you as few as one. I ordered three for $0.25 (total) and they were shipped free (in the U.S.). Yes, that's right, twenty-five cents.
		- The trick was getting the female connector out of the socket. I ended up cutting the wire and just kinda yanking it out with some very narrow pliers. Fortunately I did not damage the "mating connector" (big white nylon block that plugs into the other one).
		- I do have a [wire cutter/stripper]({{<ref "equipment/wire stripper">}}) that I used to crimp the wire into the new connector. Then I just clicked it into the mating connector and plugged it in and now it works great!
- Looks like [Package 4]({{<ref "post/2023-06-30#Package 4">}}) was finally delivered today.
- The [gray silicone mat]({{<ref "equipment/silicone mat">}}) fits perfectly on top of the galley countertop.

- The [locator dots]({{<ref "equipment/locator dots">}}) will work out well, I think. They're a little hard to see in the photos, but you can definitely feel the differences with your fingertips.

- The Firefly replacement components arrived. G12 board, LCD screen, and generator bridge.
	- I replaced all of those components and it was the Firefly/generator bridge that was causing the random shutdowns of the generator. All seems to be working now.
- While I was replacing Firefly components, I noticed some places to potentially tap 12V for extra outlets if the power center doesn't have enough current (30A max).
	- The back of the battery disconnect switch. [Owner's manual]({{<ref "post/owner's manual">}}), page 99: "CBL7 (8Ga.)" says "MAX 60A" on it and goes to the next photo.

	- M-5 and various breakers.
		- CB1 goes to the Firefly/G12 board
		- CB2 goes to the power center
		- [Owner's manual]({{<ref "post/owner's manual">}}), page 99: "CBL7 (8Ga.)" that connects to M-5, CB2 says "MAX 60A"

- The Firefly/generator bridge is impossible to unscrew on the bottom without a very short screwdriver and even then you have to unscrew the inverter and push it out of the way. Also note that if you drop a screw from one of the Firefly components it will likely fall in that crack and never be seen again.
	- Suggestion to Airstream: fill in that area so screws don't vanish down there.
