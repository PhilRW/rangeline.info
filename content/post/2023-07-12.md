This [Review of the Airstream Rangeline](https://tincanpilgrim.com/2023/07/12/review-of-the-airstream-rangeline/) by [Lynda](https://tincanpilgrim.com/author/lyndarozell/) is right on.
	- I totally agree with the electrical issues being frustrating. My inverter sometimes just stops working. It's like Airstream didn't do any testing at all. This a completely unacceptable way to make a product.
	- Note: It has 200 *Watts* of power, not 200 Amps. That would be a *huge* solar panel!
	- Note: Airstream produced the B-panel connector with two *female* connectors. I've found someone else's video fix and [documented my solution]({{<ref "post/2023-07-07">}}).
- 14:15 It's been plugged in all day and the A/C is still working, but now it says there's no charge to the house battery and the inverter is off (not passthru).
- Installed the [double shower dispenser]({{<ref "equipment/double shower dispenser">}}) under the bath mirror. Fits perfectly
