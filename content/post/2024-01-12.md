Visited Airstream of Colorado to pick up some items from Vandy Patinkin.
- Checked in with service and they have done what they can; they're waiting on parts from Airstream. The parts *may* be ready to ship, but there's no good way to know.
	- This seems like very poor logistics management on the part of Airstream.
