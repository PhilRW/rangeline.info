	- Explained that generator starts but does not continue to run. Generator shows no fault codes on the Firefly display or as a [blink code](https://thecampingadvisor.com/onan-generator-fault-codes/).
		- Page 95 of the [manual]({{<ref "post/generator manual">}}) says:
		> The status indicator light on the control switch will flash to indicate the fault code.

		- This is where the Dodge side of the chassis battery hooks into Airstreams wiring.  The wrong plug on our side was installed. Cut the blue wire off the plug. Pull Rams plug out and find the blue wire with a yellow tracer. Cut that wire and with a wago connector connect the two wires. Secure the Ram plug back into place.
		- Gain access to the Victron app. Pair to the DC/DC convertor by entering passcode 000000. Once paired to the DC/DC convertor go to settings. On the settings page there is a drop down menu called Function. Make sure that charger is selected in this drop box.
