	- ![plugs.jpg](/images/plugs_1687968564304_0.jpg) from Airstream
- [x] Order sheets from [Mattress Insider](https://www.mattressinsider.com/)
	- [Bed sizes]({{<ref "/tags/specification#bed-sizes">}})
	- bed sizes as measured
		- 53" x 74" x 3" -- ordering 53 x 74 x (3+4)
		- 51" x 79.5" x 2" -- ordering 51 x 79.5 x (2+4)
	- Nathan at Mattress Insider was very thorough on the phone taking the order. He recommended we order sheets to the size that we measured, *not* the size Airstream specifies on their website.
	- May order custom-size memory foam mattresses from him in the future, depending on how (un)comfortable the OEM mattresses are.
- Melvin from Firefly called me back and helped me troubleshoot the issue with the generator not staying running:
	- Ultimately the generator continues to run when disconnected from the Firefly system.
	- The touchscreen contains the bluetooth chip that connects to the wireless remote controls. Without the touchscreen connected to the system, the Vera smartphone app is necessary to control the system.
