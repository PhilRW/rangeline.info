It's the end of the calendar year and we have not driven it much at all because we're building a house and need to stay nearby. It has acted as a mobile office, replete with computer, scanner, and various printers.

So, unfortunately, no road trips this year. We look forward to next year. It has remained winterized all year and we have not yet fixed the cracked windshield.

On a few occasions I have noticed the inverter/charger was failing to charge the battery, whether plugged in or on generator power. Those times seemed to correlate with the weather being below freezing. I managed to reset it by shutting off the main switch and unplugging the van, then plugging it back in after a few minutes. The exact sequence escapes me but I believe I had to plug the van in and listen for the transfer switch "clunk" before then going to turn on the systems using the main disconnect.
